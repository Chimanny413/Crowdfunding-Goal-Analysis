# Excel Crowdfunding Analysis
## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of 1,000 sample crowdfunding campaigns to uncover trends and insights into campaign success and failure rates. By leveraging Excel's advanced features such as formulas, conditional formatting, pivot tables, and statistical analysis, we aimed to identify key patterns in crowdfunding data.

## Analysis Highlights
### Data Preparation and Transformation
Applied conditional formatting to highlight campaign outcomes (successful, failed, canceled, or live).

Created calculated columns for:

- Percent Funded: Campaign funding relative to its goal.
- Average Donation: Average contribution per backer.
- Parent Category and Sub-Category: Separated from a combined column.
- Converted Dates: Transformed Unix timestamps into readable date formats for analysis.

### Trend Analysis
#### 1. Category and Sub-Category Insights

  - Used pivot tables and charts to analyze campaign outcomes by category and sub-category.
  - Enabled filtering by country and parent category for detailed exploration.

#### 2. Launch Date Outcomes

  - Generated a line graph to visualize outcomes based on the creation date, filtering by category and year.

#### 3. Crowdfunding Goal Analysis

  - Categorized campaigns by funding goals and calculated success, failure, and cancellation percentages for each range.
  - Created a line chart to visualize the relationship between funding goals and campaign outcomes.

### Statistical Analysis of Backers
Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation) for backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
Compared variability and central tendency to determine trends in backer behavior.


## Conclusions
- Key Trends Identified: Certain categories, launch periods, and funding goal ranges significantly impact campaign success rates.
- Data Limitations: The dataset is a sample and may not fully represent broader crowdfunding trends.
- Opportunities for Further Analysis: Additional graphs and tables, such as regional comparisons and funding trends over time, could provide more insights.
